Accessibility Levels
After defining the 4 principles, WCAG defined 3 differents levels, the two first being absolutely required for any business and website. AAA level is recommended but not required as it may have bigger impacts on designs.

Levels
Level A (required)
A: This level improves accessibility for most sites by making it easier for browsing readers to navigate a site and translate its content, but it is still pretty basic.

Level AA (required)
AA: This level makes content accessible to people with a wider range of disabilities by providing guidance on elements such as color contrast and error identification. Regulators prefer this level.

Level AAA (optional)
AAA: The highest level of accessibility compliance, this makes content accessible to the widest range of people, but it can significantly alter the design of a site. Government legislation doesn’t typically require this because it’s not always possible to conform.
